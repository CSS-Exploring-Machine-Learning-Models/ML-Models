# Different Models
We are a project team from the CSS at Cal Poly Pomona that is exploring different machine learning models. Our primary objective is to address one problem: predicting an individual's salary based on a set of variables. Given the various models, we will then analyze, compare, and contrast the models and understand which model is the most effective.
