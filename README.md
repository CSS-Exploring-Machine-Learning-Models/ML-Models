Goals of the Project: <br>
1.Learn how to implement different algorithms to a model. ​<br>
2.Learn an outline that is applicable to most machine learning models.​ <br>
3.Learn how to identify suitable algorithms and seeking the most efficient solutions for the dataset. <br>


Technologies:<br>
Sklearn ​<br>
Seaborn ​<br>
Matplotlib​ <br>
Tensor flow ​<br>
Pandas ​<br>
Numpy <br>

The Highest Accuracy: ​<br>
<strong>Random forest.</strong> ​<br>
Most optimal given Accuracy and Program friendliness: ​<br>
<strong>Linear Regression since it is easier to implement, does not cause overfitting, and has an r^2 score of 84-89%.​</strong><br>
